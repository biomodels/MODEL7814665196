**Abstract:**   
Therapies for heart disease are based largely on our understanding of the
adult myocardium. The dramatic differences in action potential (AP) shape
between neonatal and adult cardiac myocytes, however, indicate that a
different set of molecular interactions in neonatal myocytes necessitates
different treatment for newborns. Computational modeling is useful for
synthesizing data to determine how interactions between components lead to
systems-level behavior, but this technique has not been used extensively to
study neonatal heart cell function. We created a mathematical model of the
neonatal (day 1) mouse myocyte by modifying, on the basis of experimental
data, the densities and/or formulations of ion transport mechanisms in an
adult cell model. The new model reproduces the characteristic AP shape of
neonatal cells, with a brief plateau phase and longer duration than the adult
(action potential duration at 80% repolarization = 60.1 vs. 12.6 ms). The
simulation results are consistent with experimental data, including 1)
decreased density and altered inactivation of transient outward K+ currents,
2) increased delayed rectifier K+ currents, 3) Ca2+ entry through T-type as
well as L-type Ca2+ channels, 4) increased Ca2+ influx through Na+/Ca2+
exchange, and 5) Ca2+ transients resulting from transmembrane Ca2+ entry
rather than release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Simulations
performed with the model generated novel predictions, including increased SR
Ca2+ leak and elevated intracellular Na+ concentration in neonatal compared
with adult myocytes. This new model can therefore be used for testing
hypotheses and obtaining a better quantitative understanding of differences
between neonatal and adult physiology.
